# NextJS Update Content Strategy

- Create page HTML with embedded JSON and make this HTML regenerable using the revalidate() function 
- The rest of the pages, the ones that users will see, give them revalidation in a long time, for example every one day, but update their data from the JSON generated inside the HTML using React functions useState() and useEffect() 
- This solution will reduce the number of API calls required 
- And the website will continue to be SEO friendly
